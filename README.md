# GoBarber

GoBarber is a frontend application for managing appointments at barbershops and beauty salons. Developed during the GoStack Bootcamp by Rocketseat, this React-based web interface allows service providers to manage their schedules, while users can book appointments through the mobile app.

**Note:** This frontend application works in conjunction with the [GoBarber API](https://github.com/renatosilveira99/go-barber-api), which provides the backend services required for full functionality.
